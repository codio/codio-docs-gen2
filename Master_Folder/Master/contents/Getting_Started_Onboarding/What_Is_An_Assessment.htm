  <h1>What Is An Assessment?</h1>
  <p>Assessments allow you to ask any number of automatically or manually graded questions within your content.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>They allow a student or a teacher to assess how well they are grasping the subject matter.</li>
    <li>Many assessment types are automatically graded, saving precious time for teachers and giving students instant feedback.</li>
    <li>A wide range of assessment types (automatic code tests, multiple choice tests, fill in the blanks, drop-down selection, free text responses and project grading) allow the broadest possible measurement of a student&#39;s progress.</li>
    <li>In course scenarios, all assessment responses feed through to a teacher dashboard.</li>
    <li>For multiple choice tests, fill in the blanks and drop-down selection assessment types, each individual assessment can only be answered once, giving a true reflection of understanding rather than being able to carry on answering until the correct
      answer is achieved.</li>
    <li>When an answer is submitted, the correct answer is shown to the student by default, but this can be disabled if required.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You can choose to weave assessments into the tutorial materials or to create dedicated assessments content.</p>

  <p>An <b>assessment library</b> in Codio is a collection of existing assessment items.</p>
  <p>You can <a href="" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">create assessments libraries within your organization</a>. You can organize your libraries by course number, programming language, department and store your own asesssments there
    for others to make use of and you can also <a href="" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">use existing assessments from Codio&#39;s Global library</a>.</p>
