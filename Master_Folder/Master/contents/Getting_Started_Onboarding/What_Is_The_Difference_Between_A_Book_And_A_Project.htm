  <h1>What Is The Difference Between A Book And A Project?</h1>
  <h3 data-post-processed="true">Whether to create a book or project assignment?</h3>
  <p>It can be a little confusing whether you should use a book based assignment or a project based assignment, so here are some typical use cases.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Project assignments - use when you have a collection of assessments with no or minimal tutorial content. Best used for homework or lab type assessments. If a student is not going to regularly switch assignments in a single session.</li>
    <li>Book assignments - use for tutorial content, examples and non-critical assessments. If students, when looking at one assignment, need to review content in another assignment, then a book is preferable as they can access all parts of the book if they
      need to.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You can mix both book and project assignments in a course module.</p>
