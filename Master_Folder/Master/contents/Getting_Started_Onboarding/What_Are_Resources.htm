  <h1>What Are Resources?</h1>
  <p>Codio resources are a collection of teaching materials that are available to anyone to use within their courses.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>The materials take a rigorous approach to teaching coding. As well as extensive tutorial content, you will also find a large number of challenge assessments.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Both content and assessments have been carefully built to gradually increase the difficulty level, ensuring that knowledge and confidence are built up one step at a time. This approach is important to avoid demotivating students.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Codio offers a 3 level hierarchy for organising and publishing course materials.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <ul>
    <li>A <b>Resource </b>is the top level and consists of a collection of Modules.</li>
    <li>A <b>Module</b> will typically incorporate all the course materials to cover a logical area of a curriculum or coursework. It in turn consists of a collection of assignments.</li>
    <li>An <b>Assignment </b>is the lowest level item of coursework. It will typically contain enough material to cover a particular topic or area of a curriculum or coursework. An assignment is taken directly from a Codio project.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 data-post-processed="true" id="finding-codio-resources">Finding Codio Resources</h2>
  <p>Select <b>Resources</b> from the dashboard. You will see a list of courses that are created or recommended by Codio.</p>
