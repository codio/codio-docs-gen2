  <h1>What Is A Module?</h1>
  <p>Modules help you organize your assignments in courses into logical groupings. If your course only contains a few assignments then you may want only a single module. If, on the other hand, your course has a large number of assignments, then dividing
    them between several suitably named modules may make more organizational sense.</p>
  <p>A course has to have at least one module. A module contains the individual assignments that will be assigned to students.</p>
  <p>For more information on how to create a module, add an existing module to another course, adding assignments to modules and much more, check out our documentation <a href="" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a></p>
