  <h1>How To Buy Codio In The Bookstore</h1>
  <p>Codio will work with your bookstore to ensure students on financial aid who need to buy licenses through the bookstore can purchase licenses. You can send this article or <a href="" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">email this PDF</a>    to your bookstore manager to get the process started.</p>
  <article dir="ltr">
    <h2 data-post-processed="true" id="if-you-are-a-follett-bookstore-we-are-an-approved-follett-vendor">If you are a Follett bookstore, we are an approved Follett vendor.</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Check enrollment to determine how many and what type of Codio licenses you would like to order. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>            - There are 3 durations of Codio licenses: 1-Semester, 2-Semester and 1-Year.                - Most bookstores only order 1-Semester licenses.<br/>
      <br/> 2. Send a Purchase Order (P.O.) to <a href="" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">help@codio.com</a><br/>
      <br/> 3. Receive an email with:<br/>      - a <a href="" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">printable PDF</a> that has 1 access code per page with directions for students on how to use the code<br/>      -  and a CSV file listing
      access codes for digital delivery of access codes.<br/>
      <br/> 4. Sell each access code once.<br/>      -  Codes are <b>not </b>course-specific.<br/>      - Note: A student only needs one access code for Codio, regardless of how many courses they are enrolled in that use Codio.<br/>
      <br/> 5. Pay for the access codes you sold.<br/>      - Keep any access codes you did not sell.<br/>      - They never expire and are not course-specific so they can be sold the following semester.</p>
    <p>6. Repeat steps each semester (taking in to account number of previously unsold codes when deciding quantity).</p>
    <p><b>If you are not a Follett bookstore, email </b><a href="" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><b>help@codio.com</b></a><b> to start the approval process.</b></p>
    <p>If there is ever a student who comes to the bookstore concerned that their access code did not work, please direct them to Codio support <a href="" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">as stated on their print out</a>.</p>
