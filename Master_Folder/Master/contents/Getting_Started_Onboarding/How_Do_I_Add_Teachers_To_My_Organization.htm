  <h1>How Do I Add Teachers To My Organization?</h1>
  <p>If you just want to invite your colleague into your Organisation, see <a href="" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><b>Add Teachers</b></a><b> </b>but if you would want to add them directly into your organisation AND a course at the
    same time, see <a href="" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><b>Adding Teachers to a Course </b></a><b> </b>where for either option you can send an invitation email to your colleague and it will take them through signing up for a Codio
    account and also added them into your Organisation (and Course if you take that option).</p>
  <p>You can also add teachers into courses as a <b>Read Only </b>mode. These teachers will only have access to the courses in <b>Teaching Mode</b> and will not be able to add/edit/change any content of the course. It can be done at the <a href="" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"
      target="_blank">Course level</a> and the <a href="" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Organisation level</a>.</p>
