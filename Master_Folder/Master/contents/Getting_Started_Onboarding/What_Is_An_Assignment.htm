  <h1>What Is An Assignment?</h1>
  <p>An <a href="" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">assignment</a> is essentially the same as a <a href="" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">project</a>. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>The only difference is that your project assignments are located in the course&#39;s area in the main Codio dashboard and accessible to other teachers who can edit them and to students in the course.<br/> Assignments are very easy to locate as they
    are tidily organized within the course module they belong to. You can also arrange your assignments within a course module.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><img alt="You can list the module and assignment inside a course by clicking on the " assignment="" src="" tab.="" /></p>
  <p>You would typically use an assignment if either of the following applies.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <ul>
    <li>You have a logically related series of projects that you want to assign to a student that form a course module.</li>
    <li>You have a collection of assessments relate to a course that is used for homework, lab assessments, projects, etc.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>A course allows you to subdivide your course into modules and then chronologically arrange your assignments within your modules. When you create a course, you have to create at least one module. A module does nothing special other than containing assignments
    and is simply a nice way to group your assignments.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>There is one minor drawback to project based assignments that you should be aware of. If students are working with a project assignment and want to look at tutorial content that is contained in another assignment, they have to switch assignments. This
    can take several seconds and can be irritating during a revision phase when they want to frequently switch assignments. For this reason, we created the <a href="" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">book</a>, </p>
