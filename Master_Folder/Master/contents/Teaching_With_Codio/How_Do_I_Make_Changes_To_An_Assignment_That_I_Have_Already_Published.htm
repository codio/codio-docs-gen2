  <h1>How Do I Make Changes To An Assignment That I Have Already Published?</h1>
  <p>By default, a project assignment is not available to others until you explicitly publish it. This ensures that you can make changes, even after publishing, without the published course content being affected.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Publishing the assignment takes a snapshot of the underlying project and assigns it a new version. Once published, you can make changes to your project and it will not affect the published assignment until you publish again. </p>
