  <h1>How Do I Access Student Archived Assignments?</h1>
  <p>If when trying to view a <a href="" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><b>students project</b></a> where the project has not been accessed for a long time and has been archived, it can take some time for the project to unpack.</p>
  <p>This can be time consuming for teachers/instructors especially if there are a number of students in the class and projects are relatively large.<br/> To avoid having to unpack each students project individually, teachers could <a href="" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"
      target="_blank"><b>Export Assignment Data</b></a> for that unit (from the 3 blue dot menu area)</p>
  <p> An email notification will be sent when the data is available to download then return to the students area in the class where all the students projects will no longer be archived</p>
