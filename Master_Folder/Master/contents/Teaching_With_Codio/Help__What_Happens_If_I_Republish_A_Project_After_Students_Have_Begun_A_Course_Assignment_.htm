  <h1>Help: What Happens If I Republish A Project After Students Have Started A Course Assignment?</h1>
  <p>By default, a project unit is not available to others until you explicitly publish it. This ensures that you can make changes, even after publishing, without the published course content being affected.<br/> Publishing the unit takes a snapshot of the
    underlying project unit and assigns it a new version. Once published, you can make further edits to the unit, they will not be visible until you publish the unit again.</p>

    <li>Click on <b>Courses</b> on the left-hand side of your screen and select the course you want to preview.

    <li>Click on the pencil icon if you are not in edit mode. The message below the box indicates whether you are in &quot;Edit&quot; or &quot;Teaching&quot; mode.

    </li>
    <li>Existing files in the code <b>workspace </b>are never updated as this can invalidate work for students who have already started the assignment but new files can be added.</li>
    <li>Students who haven&#39;t started the assignment will see the updated content but those who have already started an assignment will not.</li>
  </ul>
