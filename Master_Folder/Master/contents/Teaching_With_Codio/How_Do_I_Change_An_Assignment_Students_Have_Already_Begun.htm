  <h1>How Do I Change An Assignment Students Have Already Begun?</h1>
  <p>You can edit an assignment and changes will not be visible to students until you publish the assignment again. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Check out this <a href="" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">article</a> for making changes to a published assignment.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><b>Please note: </b>Existing files in the code <b>workspace </b>are never updated as this can invalidate work for students who have already started the assignment but new files can be added.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Students who haven&#39;t started the assignment will see the updated content but those who have already started an assignment will not.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>To enable students who have started the assignment to see the new content, the assignment can be <b>Reset</b> (see <b>reset</b> section under the <a href="" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Actions Area Settings</a> for more information)
    but be aware that any existing work they have done will be lost.</p>
  <p> </p>
