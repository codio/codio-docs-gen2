    <b><i>Viewing assignment as a teacher:</i></b></h2>
  <p><b><i></i></b><br/> To preview the assignment as a teacher, go to the <b>teaching</b> mode then click on the blue triple dot icon to the right of the assignment name, and choose *<b>Preview</b>*.</p>
  <figure><img src="../assets/images/preview.png" />
    <figcaption>Click the Preview option to view the assignment as a teacher</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p> </p>
  <p><b>Note:</b> Each time you preview the assignment it opens as new. i.e. anything you may add as notes to your preview is not saved.<br/>
    <br/> If you want to see the student view of the course, you can add <a href="" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">test students</a>. To open and view student class work, you can <a href="" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">access their project</a>.</p>
