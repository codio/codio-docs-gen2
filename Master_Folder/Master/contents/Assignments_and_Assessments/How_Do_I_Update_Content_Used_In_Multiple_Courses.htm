  <h1>How Do I Update Content Used In Multiple Courses?</h1>
  <p>You can update content that is used in multiple courses by creating master courses and clone courses. When you clone a course, there is a relationship between the original (master) course content and the clone (child) course content. If you update an
    assignment in the master course, the changes can be pulled (using the <b>pull</b> button) into the child courses.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>After publishing the updated content in the master course, go to the cloned course where (in &#39;edit&#39; mode) you will see the option to <b>Pull</b>.</p>

  <p> </p>
  <p>When you click on <b>Pull</b> details will be shown (as pictured below) of the update published in the master course. If you want to accept the changes, select <b>Update My Assignment</b> and they will be pulled into the assignment in the cloned course.</p>

  <p> </p>
  <p><b>Note:</b> The option to pull will only appear when there is an update available.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>New assignments added to the master course later can be added to the child courses. See <b><a href="" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Adding new assignments from Master to Child course</a> </b>for more information.</p>
