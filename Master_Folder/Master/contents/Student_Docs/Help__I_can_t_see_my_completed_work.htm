  <h1>Help: I can&#39;t see my completed work</h1>
  <p>Your Codio account is associated with an email address, used when you first registered/signed up.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>If you are accessing Codio via an LMS (Learning Management System) such as Canvas/Blackboard/Moodle and have logged into the LMS with a different email address as you then open an assignment a new Codio with a different email address will be created
    and will not see what you may have done previously and you may be prompted to start a new subscription plan.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>If you are unsure of what different email address you are using in your LMS, go to your Codio <b><a href="" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Account settings</a></b> where you can see the email address of this account.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Then check/review your LMS settings to check what other email addresses you have set to use and log out and log back into the LMS with the other email address.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>To avoid you accidentally repeating this in future, we suggest you remove all alias email addresses in your LMS account so you can only log into the LMS with the one email account in future. If unsure how contact your local LMS administrators who will
    be able to assist you</p>
