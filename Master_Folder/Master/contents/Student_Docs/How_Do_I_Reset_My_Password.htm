  <h1>How Do I Reset My Password?</h1>
  <p>You can log in with your Codio username or the registered email address.</p>
  <p>If you have also forgotten your password you can request a new password using either your username or email address.<br/>
    <br/> Resetting your password will send an email to your registered email addresss containing a link for you to click. This will then send you another email containing the new password you can then use to login. </p>
  <p>We would recommend you then change your password to something you can remember in the future.<br/> See <a href="" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Forgot your password</a> for more information. </p>
  <p>If you are a student in a Course set up by your teacher, they can also reset your password for you. More details on how they do this can be found here: <a href="" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Change students password</a>.</p>
