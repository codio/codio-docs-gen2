  <h1>How Do I Reset My Assignment To Default Configuration?</h1>
  <p>If the assignment you are referring to uses <a href="" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><b>Guides</b></a>, check out <a href="" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><b>Restore Current Files</b></a>  as that may do what
    you need but if not  discuss with your class instructor as they can <a href="" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><b>Reset Unit</b></a> for you and you can then start the unit again.  </p>
  <p>If you also let them know what you did , they may want to review the unit(s) you are working with to help mitigate this problem for you and other students in the future.</p>
