Previewing content
==================

Preview mode
************
You will regularly want to switch from editing your page content to preview it as users will see it. The best way to do this is to press the preview button in the top right of the content window. When the guide renders, it would open at the current page you were editing.

To return to the edit mode, press the **Editor** button and you will be returned to edit mode on the page that you were viewing in Play mode.
