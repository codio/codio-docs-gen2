Google Classroom
================

Integrating `Google Classroom <https://classroom.google.com/>`__ is very easy to do. ​ 

Setting up Integration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


In Google Classroom
-------------------

    - Create a Class 

In Codio
--------

    - Go to the **Admin** area in the course you wish to integrate to Google Classroom 
    - Select **Connect to Google Classroom** and authenticate to your Google account

       :alt: Connect to Google

    -  When authenticated you will be redirected to the **Classes List** page and will see a list of your Google Classes
    -  Select **Connect Class** button for the Google class you wish to connect your Codio course to ​ 
    
    |Connect to Codio| 
    
    Your Codio Course is now integrated with your Google Class 
    
.. Note:: Google classrooms do not support the ordering of modules/assignments from the Codio Course, they will be generated randomly but can easily be reordered from the **Classwork** tab in your Google Class 

Authentication and account creation
-----------------------------------

To add students/teachers see :ref:`Users account creation <lms-users>`
   
Updating
^^^^^^^^

If assignments/modules are added/removed in the Codio Course, to update to your Google Classroom 

-  Go to the **Admin** area in the course
-  Select **Update Google Classroom** to update
