If you need support, then the most effective way is to use our integrated support system. You will find this in the dashboard and the IDE.

## Dashboard
Support is available in the dashboard from the **Chat** link on the left.

## IDE
Support is available within the IDE from the **Help** menu item, then **Support**.

## Support Dialog
There is a support dialog that appears when you invoke the support option. This tracks all conversations and threads you have had with Codio and where you can also start a new conversation.

If you are in Codio, you can see when a reply to your query arrives even if you have closed the support dialog box

An email will also be sent to you if you do not see the reply within 2 minutes.

## Feedback 

We are always interested to hear from our users about their thoughts/ideas for future improvements. To raise an idea or vote on other ideas already raised, either click on **Feedback** in your dashboard area or go to [Codio Feedback](https://feedback.codio.com/) directly.

## Student Support
You can set a Contact URL for your students at the organisation level, see [Organisation Contact URL](/dashboard/organisations/#organisation-contact-url) and/or at the course level, see [Course Contact URL](/courses/classes/#course-contact-url) so they can raise any questions they may have directly to your preferred area

If you set the contact URL for a course, this will override any contact URL you may have set at the organisation level.

Students will then be given the option to report a problem, ask a question related to their course work or if they have a problem accessing the Codio platform, or loading a specific assignment.

**N.B. "Teacher" accounts will not be effected by this setting and they will still be able to contact Codio in the usual manner.**
