View Gigabox Usage
==================
Codio's default Gigaboxes are allocated 512 MB of memory. If larger boxes are needed, you can upgrade your subscription to get access to 1-GB, 2-GB, 8-GB, 16-GB and GPU (for GPU-accelerated instances) boxes.

You purchase a specific number of Gigaboxes that can be used by anyone in your organization. Codio tracks usage based on active projects rather than total projects. In other words, you can have 100 projects which use a Gigabox but as long as only one is active at a time, this requires only a single gigabox unit to be purchased.

To view the status of your current Gigabox usage for all users, follow these steps:
