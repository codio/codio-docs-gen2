Release Grades
==============
By default students are not shown the grades until you decide to release them to the course. This allows you to release all the grades at once after the grading process has been completed. To learn more about release grades, view the <video> (https://codio.wistia.com/medias/z7xmzl5xbd?wvideo=z7xmzl5xbd).

If you want to release the grades as the assignments are graded, follow these steps:

1. Open the course and click the **Admin** tab.
2. Click Edit Details in the lower portion of the page.
3. Toggle the **Release Grades Automatically** setting to enable it.
