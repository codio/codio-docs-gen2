Grade Assignments
=================
Codio offers the following grading features:

- **Assign Grade** - Manually review student projects and assign a grade.
- **Grading Moderation** - Other instructors review grades already assigned to monitor grading consistency.
- **Grading Rubric** - A two-dimensional grid that provides grading guidance for manually assessing a coding project.
- **LMS Gradebook Synchronization** - Ensures that when grades are released, the data is automatically passed to any LTI enabled LMS platform such as Moodle, Blackboard and Canvas.

Grading process
---------------
Once students have completed their assignments, they notify the teacher by using the **Education > Mark as Completed** menu in the IDE. Instructors can also mark the assignment as complete or change the status to incomplete. Follow these steps to view and grade the assignments:

1. Open the assignment and view the students that have a green check mark to the left of their name. This indicates that they have marked as complete.

  If the students assignment has already been graded, another teacher in the course can click **Override Grade** to edit the grade with additional comments.

Anonymous grading
-----------------

To enable anonymous grading, follow these steps:

1. Open the course and click the **Admin** tab.
2. Click **Edit Details** in the lower portion of the page.
