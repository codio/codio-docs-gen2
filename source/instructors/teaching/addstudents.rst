Inviting students to your course
================================

See :ref:`Add or Remove Students in a Course <add-remove-students>`

.. Note:: When integrating with an external system, you do not :ref:`add/invite <add-remove-students>` students or teachers to your course. All is handled when the users access an assignment in the system mapped to Codio and the features to invite students into the course are not enabled.
