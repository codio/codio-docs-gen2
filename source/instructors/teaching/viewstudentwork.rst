Viewing student work
====================


As a teacher you have access to your students cloud area within Codio. This allows you to view and access any work your students have completed at any time. You can enable writable mode to be able to make changes if necessary. Changes made when in writable mode are not saved and do not affect the students work.

1. From the **Courses** area, click on your course to open it.

1. You will see all students in your course displayed on this screen. By default they will show sorted alphabetically by first name but you can also sort them by last name, number of started or number of completed assignments if preferred.

1. To view/access an individual students work click on their name. On the far right of the screen, under the heading **Open**, click the blue arrow to open the students work.
