### Simple vs Complex Layouts
In Codio's assessments libraries, there are two types of layouts:

- **Simple**

  An assessment in the library has a **simple** layout if it was added with the [*1 Panel without tree* layout](/courses/settings-actions/#page). When adding a simple layout question to your project or book, the assessment will be inserted into the current page at your cursor's location.

- **Complex**

  An assessment in the library has a **complex** layout if it was added with any layout besides 1 Panel without tree. When adding a complex layout question to your project or book, the assessment will be inserted on a new page directly after the current page.

### How do you tell the difference?
When you are filtering the assessments library, you will notice the "complex layout" icon on assessments saved with a complex layout. All assessments without the icon are simple layout assessments.
