## Adding Questions to an Assessments Library
Once an assessment is added to an assessment library, it can be accessed later and added to a project or course with ease. Adding assessments to an assessment library has a few simple steps. Before you begin, you or someone else in your organization with [adminstrator access](/dashboard/organisations/#administrator-role) needs to [create an organization assessments library](/dashboard/organisations/#create-an-organization-assessments-library) if you do not already have one.

1. The first step is creating the assessment. It is similar to how you [normally create an assessment](/courses/assessments/#assessments) with a few things you should note:

  * Assessments on pages set to the [*1 Panel without tree* layout](/courses/settings-actions/#layout) will be saved with a [simple layout](/courses/assessments-library/#simple-vs-complex-layouts).

  * Use [the metadata tab](/courses/assessments/#metadata) to tag your assessment so it appears when the [assessments library is searched](/courses/assessments-library/#searching-assessments-library)

  * Use [the files tab](/courses/assessments/#files) to ensure all dependent files such as grading scripts, images used in the guides pane, etc. are associated with the assessment so it works properly when added from the library

  Once the assessment is written, we can add it to an assessment library. Click the **"SAVE IN LIBRARY"** button on the bottom right of the window:
   ![Save to library](/img/guides/assessment-save-to-library.png)


1. A window will appear with a dropdown menu of all the available libraries that the question can be added to. Choose the desired library from the dropdown menu.

1. Once the desired library has been chosen, press the **"ADD"** button.

The assessment has now been added to the chosen library.

If you get an error message, you may not have [write access to your organization's assessment library](/dashboard/organisations/#add-collaborators-to-an-assessments-library).

Once a question has been added, [follow these steps to update the assessment in your organization's library.](/courses/assessments-library/#unlinking-and-updating-assessments-from-library)

Additionally, you can [disconnnect questions](/courses/assessments-library/#unlinking-an-assessment) from [Codio's global assessments library](/courses/assessments-library/#codios-global-assessments-library), modify them, and then add your version using the steps above!
