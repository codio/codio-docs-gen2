Assessments Library
===================
An **assessment library** in Codio is a collection of existing assessment items that you can add to or pull from to include in your assignments. You can create your own :ref:`organization assessment library <org-library>` or use the :ref:`Codio Global Assessment Library <global-library>`.

You can organize your library by course number, programming language, department, etc. and filter the library based on tags when searching for assessments.

Review the following topics to get started using the Assessments Library:

- :ref:`Add Questions to an Assessments Library <add-questions-to-library>`
- :ref:`Codio Global Assessments Library <global-library>`
- :ref:`Update an Existing Assessment in Library <update-library>`
