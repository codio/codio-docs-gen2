Assessments Library
===================
An **assessment library** in Codio is a collection of existing assessment items.

You can [create assessments libraries within your organization](/dashboard/organisations/#create-an-organization-assessments-library). You can organize your libraries by course number, programming language, department, etc.

You can [use existing assessments from Codio's Global library.](/courses/assessments-library/#codios-global-assessments-library)

To navigate through an assessments library, [you filter based on tags.](/courses/assessments-library/#searching-and-adding-questions-from-the-assessments-library) The Codio assessments library has a number of tags - your organization can come up with a convention that works for you!
