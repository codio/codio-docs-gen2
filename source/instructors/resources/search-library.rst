## Searching and Adding questions from the Assessments Library
Regardless of whether you are using [Codio's global assessments library](/courses/assessments-library/#codios-global-assessments-library) or [your organization's assessment library](/dashboard/organisations/#organization-assessments-library), the steps for searching for and adding assessments from them are the same.

### Searching Assessments Library
From the assessments drop down, select the "Assessment Library" option.

Use the drop down on the left to indicate which assessments library you want to search.

To narrow down the assessments, input a tag and value pair. For example, you can search by the "Programming Language" (tag) and indicate you want "Python" (value) questions. The search is **not** case-sensitive. You will notice that Codio tries to help you by presenting auto-complete suggestions.

You can also click on any of the tag fields you see in the current results and it will automatically filter to those and add a new row to your search query

Once you have completed inputting the tag and value pair, you will get a list of results.

You can add as many additional tag and value pairs or by clicking on tag:value pair currently shown to narrow your results by clicking the plus sign to the right of the value box.

To navigate through your search results, you can use the scroll bar on the right to scroll through assessments on a page. Once you reach the bottom, you can use the page navigation in the top left to move backwards/forwards a page or jump to a certain page of results.

### Previewing Question
You can get a sneak peek of the question text by clicking within a listed assessment's white box. The question text will appear below the listed value/tag pairs.

If you preview a second question, the first preview will collapse.

### Saving Searches
If you find a set of particular search parameters you want to save, you can do so by simply clicking the "Save" button to the right of the tags and values boxes.

A prompt will ask you for the "Search Name" - this is how it will be listed in your saved search list.

### Using Saved Searches
To use a saved search, you click on the "Saved" drop down to the right of the tags and values boxes. Select the search you want to use by clicking on it's name.
![Saved searches](/img/savedSearch.png)

You will then be able to see all the parameters you saved previously. You can edit these search parameters freely without changing your saved search.


If you find a set of search parameters you like better, you can simply save the new set and delete your old search.

### Deleting Saved Searches
To remove a saved search, you click on the "Saved" drop down to the right of the tags and values boxes. Delete the saved search by clicking on the red "x" to the right of it's name.
