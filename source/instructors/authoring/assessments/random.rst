Random Assessment
=================

The Random assessment type allows you to set up a group of assessments to then randomly assign one to each individual student assignment. 

1. On the **General** page, enter the name of your assessment that describes the test. This name is displayed in the teacher dashboard so the name should reflect the challenge and thereby be clear when reviewing.

2. On the **Grading** page, enter the amount of points to assign to the assessment. Enter the score for correctly answering the question they are assigned. You can choose any positive numeric value. If this is an ungraded assessment, enter zero (0).

3. On the **Execution** page, browse to an assessment library where you can set up filters define the range of assessments to randomly assign. You can work from any assessment library you have access to.

Updating Random assessments
---------------------------

If assessments that are assigned to the random assessment are updated and the assignment has been published, the changes made can be updated/synchronised so the students can then have access to the updated assignments.

A **Sync** button will be shown on the **Edit** tab for the assignment if there are changes that can be updated/synchronised.

If there are students that have already started the assignment they will not get the updates/changes unless their assignments is also reset so they will start again 'as new' and any previous work will be lost.

Pressing the **Sync** button will identify if there are students who have already started and then give you the option to reset and publish or just publish so then only students who have not started the assignment will get the update/changes
