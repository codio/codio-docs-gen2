Assessments
===========
Assessments can be used to determine how well students understand course material, and can be automatically or manually graded. Codio offers a wide range of assessment types, including autom-graded code tests, multiple choice tests, fill in the blanks, drop-down selection, free text responses and assignment grading. Assessments can be interspersed throughout tutorial materials or stand alone using an :ref:`assignment level script <auto-grade-scripts>`. 

For multiple choice tests and fill in the blanks assessments only one attempt is allowed. When an answer is submitted, the correct answer is shown to the student by default, but this can be disabled.

You can view the results of assessments in a course from the teacher dashboard.
