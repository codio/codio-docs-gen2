Hiding folders
==============

Your content will often want to show code samples. Codio's recommended approach is to put each set of code samples into a dedicated folder. Then, using **Show Folders** on :ref:`page settings <show-hide-folders>`, you can specify this folder. All non-specified folders are hidden from view in the file tree.
