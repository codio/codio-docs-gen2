For K12 and University organizations, the billing screen allows you to generate invoices for your account (for new accounts and renewal of existing accounts),for active subscriptions, view the details of the current plan, enter the email of the person who should receive billing notifications and also where you can switch your organization to **Student Pay** where students are prompted to enter a credit card when they sign up.

To access the organization billing screen:

1. Click on your profile picture (bottom left of **Courses**)

|Profile| 

1. Click the name of your organization (under **My Organizations**)

|Org Name|

Select the country you are in and 'Save'. Then enter the number of student licenses required. The plans available will be shown , select the plan you require and if you require the invoice to be sent to someone else, you can change the recipient.

If you have a promotion code, enter it in the appropriate field. Validation is case insensitive.

-  If the promotion code is invalid, the message
   ``Invalid promotion code`` will be shown
-  If the promotion code has expired, the message
   ``This promotion code has expired`` will be shown
-  Promotion codes are only available for new users and not available
   for self pay plans.

When you are ready, click the 'Generate Invoice' button and the invoice will be generated and sent to the email address.

The option to switch to a Self Pay plan where students are prompted to enter a credit card when they sign up is also available but be aware if you have an annual plan and have already paid this might lead to a conflict.
