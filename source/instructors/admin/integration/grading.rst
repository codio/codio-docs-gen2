Grading
=======

When grades are :ref:`released <release-grades>` a URL is passed to the LMS where students/teachers can access the grading information for the assignment in the grading area of the LMS

By default, only the course teachers and the individual student can access the grading preview URL but by enabling the LMS shared feedback option for the course, this will pass a different URL back to your LMS system where anyone who knows the URL can access the students grading information

To enable this go to your course **Admin** tab, select **Edit Details** and then toggle the switch to enable.
