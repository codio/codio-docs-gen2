In Canvas
~~~~~~~~~

The Canvas user who carries out these steps must be a system administrator.

4.  Create a new Course in your LMS system. We suggest you create a test course called **Codio Test Course** before you do it with a production course.
5.  Select the Course.
6.  Click on **Settings** in the left set of options.
7.  In the top links, select **Apps**.
8.  Click the large button **View App Configurations**.
9.  Click on the **View App Center** button.

10.  Navigate (or filter) to find the **Codio** app, select and **+ Add App**

In Codio and Canvas
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

11. We will now copy the following global integration fields from Codio to Canvas.

-  LTI Consumer -> Consumer Key
-  LTI Secret -> Shared Secret

12. and select the **Add App** button to confirm. You should then have something similar to this:

Course LMS URL
--------------

The **Course LMS URL** is used to map an LMS course to a Codio course. It ensures that Codio knows how to redirect students back to the correct course should they attempt to access the course through the Codio dashboard. If not entered and students log into Codio to try to start new assignments there will be no link for them to click to be passed to your LMS Course. The LMS user who carries out these steps does not need to be a system administrator but must have suitable privileges to edit courses and assignments.

13.  In Codio, go to the **LTI/LMS** tab near the top.
14.  Go to the **LTI/LMS Settings** section.
15.  Select **Enable LTI** to enable.
16.  Below this is an empty field **Course LMS URL**. Switch back to your LMS and make sure you are on the Home page of the course. Copy the url in the address bar of your browser to the clipboard and paste it into the above mentioned field in Codio.

.. _hide-assignments:

Hiding not started assignments in students dashboard
****************************************************

Toggling **Hide Not Started Assignments** to on will suppress the display of assignments that havenâ€™t been started in the student dashboard. Students will need to log into their LMS system to start new assignments. As they may not always recall how, it can be better to use the **Course LMS URL** instead where they will then see a link to the course they can just click to get into the LMS and be able to start new assignments.

============================================

The final mapping step needs to be taken for each individual assignment within Codio. It maps a Canvas assignment to a Codio assignment.

17.  Make sure you are in the Courses area.
18.  Click on the **Assignments** link in the left hand side.
19.  Provide a name for the Assignment.

21.  Scroll down and look for the **Submission Type** field.
