LTI Enrol to Course Only
========================

You can allow students to enrol into a Codio course from the LMS. You need to generate a link from your Codio course and then you can add that link to your LMS course. When a student clicks that link, they will be enrolled in Codio course and redirected to the Codio dashboard where they can see all the assignments present in that course. Students doesn't need to go to LMS to start the assignment, they can start/open the assignment from Codio directly.

To generate LTI enrol link, follow the below steps:

1. Navigate to the **Courses** page and select the course to open it.
2. Click **LTI/LMS** tab and turn ON the **Enable LTI** setting from LTI/LMS Setting area.
3. Enable **Enrol to course only** setting to generate the link.


.. Note:: When you enabled the **Enrol to course only** setting, Grades will not be passed back to the LMS although you can use a :ref:`Webhook <webhooks>` if required.
