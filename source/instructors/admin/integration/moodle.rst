Please be sure to check out the :ref:`Codio LTI App <lti-app>` which allows for an easy way to integrate and to map Codio course assignments to your LMS system. Moodle added support for LTIâ„¢ apps in version 2.2. The `following page <https://docs.moodle.org/32/en/External_tool_settings>`__ explains how to set up external apps in Moodle.

Setup and configuration
-----------------------

**Important** : Codio needs the User Role, Email Address and Name of the Moodle user in order to work. It is important that you access the LTI security settings and ensure that these three fields are always enabled. If they are not available, contact Moodle support who can help you enable this. If enabled after you have mapped Codio content to Moodle, you may need to re publish for the changes to be implemented

Authentication and account creation
-----------------------------------

Once you have configured the LTI/LMS settings, Moodle manages all aspects of signing in to Codio as well as account creation. All your teachers and students need is a Moodle account.

If a Moodle user has never used Codio before then an account will automatically be created from their email address when they access their first Codio course materials.

If a Moodle user already has a Codio account then provided the email address of their Moodle account is the same, the same Codio account will be used.
