Set Organization Contact URL
============================
You can set your own contact URL for your students to use on the Organization Settings page. You may want to specify a contact URI if you have a forum or LMS discussion area for students to use or if you have your own resources available to assist students. Follow these steps to set a contact URL:

1. Click your profile icon in the lower left corner of the screen.

   You can add as many contact URLs as necessary to give students different options depending on the help they need. When multiple contact options are set, students are shown all of the options in addition to contacting Codio.
