Remove Organization Members
===========================
There are some occasions where you may want to remove old members in order to make room for new members; for example, if students in a course leave and you want to use the account licences for other students. Follow these steps to remove members from your organization:

1. Click your profile icon in the lower left corner of the screen.

4. In the **Organization Teams** section, click **All Members** to view all the members of your school organization. Alternatively, click **Users without Courses** to display students who were removed due to the course being deleted.
