Enable or Disable Releasing Grades Automatically
================================================
By default, students are not shown their grades until the instructor releases them to the course. However, you can enable the Release Grades Automatically feature, which releases the grades when the students complete the assignment.

Follow these steps to enable releasing grades automatically:

**Note:** Enabling this feature does not affect existing courses. You can enable this feature on individual courses if needed.
