  - If you send them the **Invite URL**, they can paste it into their browser and are automatically taken through the sign-up process. When they select that they are a teacher, they are added to your organization.
  - If you send them the **Invite Token**, they can register themselves for a Codio account using the sign-up process at www.codio.com. They provide the token to join your organization.

**Note:** If you already have courses set up, you can add and invite teachers directly into your course(s). See :ref:`Add or Remove Teachers in a Course <add-teachers>`. You can then add them as an :ref:`organization owner <org-owners>` so they can then manage and create courses, and have full Admin access to the organization.
