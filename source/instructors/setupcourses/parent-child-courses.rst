Working with Parent/Child Courses
=================================
When a course is created by cloning or using a share code, the course (child) is tied to the original (parent) course so that any updates to an assignment in the parent course are also updated in the child course. 

Update & pull updates
---------------------
After an update in the parent course has been published, from **"Edit"** mode, a **Pull** icon will appear next to the assignments that have changed. Follow these steps to pull the updates.

1. In the Dashboard, select the course to open it and click on the **Edit** tab. The assignments that have changed show a **Pull** icon.

  .. Note:: Pulling updates from the parent course overwrites changes made in the child course. 
  
Update & pull updates - with notification sent to child courses
---------------------------------------------------------------
Some people prefer to **send notifications** to alert child courses of updates. After an update in the parent course has been published, you can send a notification that displays a banner in the child course(s) informing all instructors that there are available updates.

To send notifications, follow these steps:

1. In the Dashboard, select the course to open it and then click the **Admin** tab.

2. Click the **Send New Notification** link in the lower left corner of the page.

3. In the **Notification Message** text box, enter the message to instructors that explains the changes that have been made to the parent course and are now available in the child course.

   The message can include details of all the changes made in each assignment or just be a summary. If a summary is included, instructors can pull the assignments and review the information in the publish assignment changelog. 

  .. Note:: To view a history of all notifications sent for published updates in the parent course, click the **View Sent Notification** link.

4. After a notification has been sent, a **Download** icon is displayed in the upper right corner of the course.

Add new assignments from parent to child courses

When a new assignment has been added in the parent course, it will not automatically be added to child courses. Rather, child courses will need to add it manually to allow future updates to be pulled. Follow these steps to add an assignment from the parent course to the child course:

1. In the Dashboard, select the child course to open it and go to the **Edit** tab.

2. Select the module and click **Add assignment**.

You can revert back to earlier published versions of your courses. However, reverting automatically publishes the course and it's available to your students.

1. In the Dashboard, select the course to open it and go to the **Edit** tab.
