Courses Overview
================

A course is a grouping of students who are taught as a logical group. One of the main tasks for instructors is to create the courses for their students, and then add content (modules and assignments), share it with others, add teachers and students to it, and other tasks. 
With courses, you can instantly access student code and projects. 

You can also integrate the course with any LTI-enabled LMS platform such as Canvas, D2L, Moodle, Blackboard and many others. Your LMS can auto-populate courses and grade data can be fed back from Codio to the LMS.
