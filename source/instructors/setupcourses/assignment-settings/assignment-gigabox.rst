Gigabox Slot
========================
If you have a memory intensive assignment, you can specify here that it should use a Gigabox slot. Gigabox slots are allocated on an :ref:`organization level <gigabox-usage>`. You must change this assignment setting in the course, it isn't sufficient to set a larger Gigabox in the assignment.
