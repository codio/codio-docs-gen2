Prerequisite Assignments
========================

The **Prerequisite Assignment** is used to set requirements based on other published assignments in the course so that students cannot start the assignment until they have been met. 

The prerequisite states that can be set are:

- Started
- Completed
- Passed (with a minimum grade)

Multiple assignments can be included if necessary but they all will have the same prerequisite state.

When enabled, students can start the assignment if the requirements are met. If not, they will receive a message advising them of the prerequisite requirements.

Copy workspace from Prerequisite Assignment
-------------------------------------------

If an assignment is selected in the dropdown, when the assignment is created, a copy of the selected prerequisite assignment's workspace will be included in the new assingment.

.. Note:: This will only pull the workspace in upon the first opening of the assignment (when it is created for the student) -- there is no update mechanism. Because of this, we highly encourage you to setup the prerequisite assignment being populated to **Completed**.
