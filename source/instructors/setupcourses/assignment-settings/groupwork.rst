Pair Programming
================

The Paired Programming setting is enabled to allow groups of students to work together on assignments.  Within each group a student will be a **Driver** who has the ability to edit and make changes in the assignment and others in the group will be **Navigators** who can view the work done by the **Driver**. Control can be passed between the driver and navigators as required. See below

- **Paired Programming** - Enable to auto-assign students into groups. Groups can be between 2 and 5 students. See below
 
- **Shared Focus** - Enable to apply Shared Focus.  Shared focus means the "navigator" sees exactly what the "driver" sees. This prevents students in the "navigator" role from manipulating the view of the driver (changing guide pages, opening other code files, etc).

- **Number of Students** - Set the number of students to work together as a group (max 5). If the total number of students is greater than an equal division for the groups, extra groups will be created

Managing Groups
---------------

Once groups have been set up and saved, teachers/instructors can manage the groups going to the **Groups** Tab that will then be shown and **Arrange Groups** button to move students between the groups and/or rename the groups

Adding New Students
-------------------

If new students join the course after Pair Programming is enabled, they will automatically be added to any existing group that is not already at the maximum number of students. If all groups are already at the maximum number a new group will be created. Teachers/Instructors may then want to review the existing groups so there are no students operating on their own in their own group.

Driver/Navigator
----------------

Within a group there is a **Driver** who has control of the assignment and **Navigators** who are able to view the work being done by the driver where they can see the drivers cursor location and selections (similar to googleDocs). If the cursor cannot be seen (e.g. the driver is on another page or file in the assignment), clicking on the drivers username in the top panel will take the navigator to their location

To transfer control between users, the navigator can flip the toggle switch next to "Driver" to request control.

If driver is not actively typing, control automatically transfers. If they are they will get a notification asking for control. This will not block them from continuing their work and when the are ready to release control, the can toggle the switch to transfer control to the requestor.
