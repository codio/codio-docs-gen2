Penalties
=========

You can add penalties to the assignment if students don't complete it within the specified start time and closing time.

Penalties are not cumulative. Your student will receive the penalty associated with their submission date.

.. Note:: It is recommended that you set the closing date/time for the assignment (see :ref:`Assignment Duration <assignment-duration>`) to the last date/time for the penality to avoid having to change the assignment status for a student who submits the assignment late.

Add Penalties
-------------
To add a penalty for a late assignment, follow these steps:

1. Open the assignment **Settings**.
2. In the **Penalties** area, click **Add Penalty** and complete the following fields:

   - **Number** (auto-incremental)
   - **Date** - The date the penalty is applied. 
   - **Time** - The time the penalty is applied on the specified date.
   - **Penalty %** - Percentage of the total score for the assignment to be deducted as a penalty.
   - **Message** - Description of the penalty. If a message is not specified, one of the following default messages is displayed:

     - If a student opens a project after the deadline or the student is working in the assignment when deadline is reached, the following message is displayed:

      ```Deadline X (the table row number) has been reached. This deadline carries a penalty of Y%. You can review your answers with no penalty. However, if you decide to change any answers by pressing the Modify button beneath a question, a Y% penalty deduction will be applied to your overall results. Once a modify button has been pressed once, the penalty deduction will be applied and you will be free to modify as many questions as you like with no additional penalty```

     - If a student clicks Modify after the deadline has passed, the following message is displayed:

      ```Deadline X (the table row number) has been reached. This deadline carries a penalty of Y%. If you proceed, a Y% penalty deduction will be applied to your overall results. You will then be able to modify as many questions as you like with no additional penalty```

     - If the final deadline has passed, the assignment is forced to read-only and the following message is displayed:

      ```You have exceeded the final deadline. You are no longer able to make changes to your answers. You are free to review your answers.```

3. Click **Save Changes**.
