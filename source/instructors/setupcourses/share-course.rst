Share Course

2. Toggle the **Course share code** button to **On** and a code is generated.

3. Click the **Copy to Clipboard** icon next to the code to share it with others.

To manage access to the course code, toggle the **Course share** code button to **Off** after you have shared the code, or click **Regenerate** to create a new code. When you regenerate a new code, the old code is disabled and can no longer be used.

To restrict a course that is shared or cloned from a master course from being shared or cloned further, toggle Course share code to On and check the Licensed check box.

**Note:** Child courses created from licensed master courses cannot be shared or cloned, and the content cannot be added to other courses, modules, or assignments.
