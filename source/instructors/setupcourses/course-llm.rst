If students exceed any of the limits set above, they will show in the **Reset LLM Keys** area and the teacher/instructors can reset the keys for them to continue working.  

If a student exceeds more than one limit at same time, they will only show once and reetting will reset them for all exceeded limits

.. Note:: Students WILL need to restart their box after being limits are reset (**Project>Restart Box**) but if you hide the top menu then teachers should restart the box for them - open the student assignment where they will see the main menu and can **Project>Restart Box** before letting the student know they can continue
