Pyret
=====

Pyret is now available in Codio.

|pyret|

.. Warning:: :ref:`Pair Programming <group-work>` should not be used for Pyret assignments. 

With :ref:`Codio guides <guides-intro>` you can provide instructions for an assignment side-by-side with the Pyret environment.


To create an empty Pyret project in Codio, select **File > New** from the Codio menu and create a file with an **.arr** suffix. 

You can set up your Guide to :ref:`automatically open <open-tabs>` files you want your students to use. If you don't want the guide to take up screen space, you can set it up to `collapse on open <global>`__ or students can simply click on the files in the file tree for them to open in Pyret.
