Scratch
=======


The desktop version of Scratch in now available in Codio. This version of Scratch has all the features of the online version but because it is the standalone version, students wonâ€™t be able to view or comment on Scratch community projects.

With :ref:`Codio guides <guides-intro>` you can provide instructions for an assignment side-by-side with the Scratch development environment.

To create an empty Scratch project in Codio, select **File > New** from the Codio menu and create a file with an .sb3 suffix. You can set up
your Guide to :ref:`automatically open <open-tabs>` the Scratch file you want your students to use. If you don't want the guide to take up screen
space, you can set it up to :ref:`collapse on open <global>`.

To use a project you have already created on the web version of Scratch, open the project in Scratch and select **File > Save to your computer** then in Codio select **File > Upload** and open the Scratch file you downloaded.

Scratch files are **not saved automatically**, students must select **File > Save** to save their work although a warning will be shown to students when they mark the assignment as completed for them to confirm before the assignment is marked as completed. This ensures that any unsaved work is saved.

Get started by clicking on **Tutorials** in the Scratch menu area. For more information see `Scratch <https://scratch.mit.edu/about>`__.
