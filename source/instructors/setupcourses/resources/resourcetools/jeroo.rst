Jeroo
=====

Jeroo is now available in Codio as a `Stack <stacks>`__.

|jeroo|

With `Codio guides <intro>`__ you can provide instructions for an assignment side-by-side with the Jeroo environment.

Start by creating either a new project or assignment in your course, selecting the **Jeroo** stack

When created, select **File > New** from the Codio menu and create a file with an **.jev** suffix for a map file or **.jsc** for a program file.

You can set up your Guide to `automatically open <open-tabs>`__ files you want your students to use. If you don't want the guide to take up screen space, you can set it up to `collapse on open <global>`__ or students can simply click on the files in the file tree for them to open in Jeroo

Jeroo files are **not saved automatically**, you must select **File > Save** to save your work.

For more information on Jeroo, `click here <https://gitlab.com/unomaha/jeroo/-/blob/master/README.md>`__
