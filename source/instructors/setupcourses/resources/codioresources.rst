Codio's scaffolded resources use an interactive approach so students can actively construct knowledge. Students are presented with code samples as well as an online IDE so they can experiment hands-on. Codio instructional resources are completely editable and can be customized to suit your teaching context. You can mix-and-match different resources together and add your own content.
