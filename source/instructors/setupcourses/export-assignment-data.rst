Export Assignment Data
======================
Use this to export data related to a specific assignment. Exported data includes student workspace files, in a zip archive for each student. If students have completed the assignment there will also be a .csv file with information such as number of assessment attempts, completion date, time spent, final grade and more.

Follow these steps to export assignment data:

1. Open the course and expand the course module.
2. Click the **Options** menu (the 3 dots on the far right) for the assignment and choose **Export Assignment Data**. 

   An email notification is sent when the data is available for download.
