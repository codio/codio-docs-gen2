Export Assignment Data
======================
If you would like to view student progress and many of the student's projects are archived, you can export assignment data for the assignment instead of downloading the project and unpacking it, which can be time consuming. Follow these steps to export assignment data:

1. Open the course and expand the course module.
2. Click the **Options** menu for the assignment and choose **Export Assignment Data**. 

   An email notification is sent when the data is available for download.
