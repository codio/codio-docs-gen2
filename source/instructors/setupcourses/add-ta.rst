Add Teaching Assistant to a Course
===================================

Teaching assistants can be added to a course by sending them an invite. They can then switch between being a teacher and a student. When they are in teacher mode, they can see all the courses in which they are set as a teacher; when in student mode, they see all the courses in which they are set as a student. 

Follow these steps to add a teaching assistant to a course:

1. From the **Courses** page, select the course to open it.
2. Click the **Admin** tab.

6. Click **Send Invite** and click **Yes** on the confirmation dialog.   
    
7. In the **Teachers** section on the **Admin** page, click **Done** to save your changes.
