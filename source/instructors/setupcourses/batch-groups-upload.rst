You can download the csv template file from **Download Template** setting present in the **Group Settings** area. You can update the fields as per your requirement and use that csv file to upload/arrange student groups.

The CSV contains 3 columns:

- **group_name** - enter the names you want to assign to the groups like Group 1, Group 2, etc.
- **user_id** - enter student's id to whom you want to assign to that particular group
- **user_email** - enter student's email address to whom you want to assign to that particular group

One of the user_id or user_email fields is required.
