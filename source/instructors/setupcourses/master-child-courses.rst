Working with Master/Child Courses
=================================
When a course is created by cloning or using a share code, the course (child) is tied to the original (master) course so that any updates to an assignment in the master course are also updated in the child course. 

Update and send notification to child courses
---------------------------------------------
After an update in the orignal course has been published, you can send a notification that displays a banner in the child course informing all instructors that there are available updates.

To send notifications, follow these steps:

1. In the Dashboard, select the course to open it and then click the **Admin** tab.

2. Click the **Send New Notification** link in the lower portion of the page.

   The message can include details of all the changes made in each assignment or just be a summary. If a summary is included, instructors can pull the assignments and review the information in the publish assignment changelog. 

   **Note:** To view a history of all notifications sent for published updates in the master course, click the **View Sent Notification** link.

   After a notification has been sent, a **Download** icon is displayed in the upper right corner of the course.

Updating without notifications
------------------------------
You can also make changes to a master course without sending update notifications. After an update in the orignal course has been published, a **Pull** icon is displayed on the assignments that have changed (when in Edit mode). Follow these steps to pull the updates.

1. In the Dashboard, select the course to open it. The assignments that have changed show a **Pull** icon.

   **Note:** You can also click **Pull All** to pull all available updates for the module but you cannot view the details.

Add new assignments from master to child courses
------------------------------------------------
After a new assignment has been added in the master course, you can add it to the child course and allow future updates to be pulled. Follow these steps to add an assignment from the master course to the child course:

1. In the Dashboard, select the child course to open it.

2. Select the module and click **+ Add assignment**.

3. On the **Create Assignment** dialog, click **Existing**

4. Select the master course, module and assignment(s) to be added to the child course. The assignment in the child course is automatically published.

Revert to earlier version
-------------------------
You can revert back to earlier published versions of your courses. However, reverting automatically publishes the course and it's available to your students.

1. In the Dashboard, select the course to open it.

2. On the **Assignments** page, click the **Revert** icon in the **Versions** column.
