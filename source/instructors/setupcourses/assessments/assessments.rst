Assessments
===========
Assessments are used to determine how well students are grasping the course content, and can be various automatically or manually graded questions. Codio offers a wide range of assessment types, including automatic code tests, multiple choice tests, fill in the blanks, drop-down selection, free text responses and project grading. You can also choose to weave assessments into the tutorial materials or create dedicated assessments content. All responses are shown in the teacher dashboard.

For multiple choice tests, fill in the blanks, and drop-down selection assessment types, each individual assessment can be answered only once, which provides a true reflection of understanding rather than the student being able to continue answering until the correct answer is achieved. When an answer is submitted, the correct answer is shown to the student by default, but this can be disabled if required.
In course scenarios, all assessment responses feed through to a teacher dashboard.
