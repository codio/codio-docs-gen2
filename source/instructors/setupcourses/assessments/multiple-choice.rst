  - **Correct Points** - Enter the score if the student selects the correct answer. You can choose any positive numeric value. If this is an ungraded assessment, enter zero (0).

  - **Incorrect Points** is the score to be deducted if the student makes an incorrect selection. Typically, this value will be 0 but you can assign any positive numeric value if you wish to penalize guessing. If this assessment is to be ungraded, set '0' points

  - **Allow Partial Points** - Toggle to enable a percentage of total points to be given based on the percentage of answers they correctly answer.

  - **Show Expected Answer** - Toggle to enable if you want to show the students the expected output when they have submitted an answer for the question.

  - **Answer and Rationale** - Enter guidance for the assessment. This is visible to the teacher when the project is opened in the course or when opening the student's project. This guidance information can also be shown to students after they have submitted their answer and when they reload the assignment after marking it as completed.
