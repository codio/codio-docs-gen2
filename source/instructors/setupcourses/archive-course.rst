Archive Course
==============
To help manage the number of courses visible to instructors, you can archive courses so they are no longer visible on the **Active** page. When a course is archived, it is moved to the **Archived** page and is read-only. Students can still see their grades/feedback but they cannot continue working on assignments in an archived course. You can move an archived course back to the **Active** page at any time.

To archive a course, follow these steps:

1. On the **Courses** page, click the **Active** tab if it's not already selected.
2. Click the **Options** menu in the upper right corner of the course listing and choose **Archive Course**.
3. In the confirmation dialog, enter **make read-only** and click **Yes**.

To move an archived course to the **Active** page, follow these steps:

1. On the **Courses** page, click the **Archived** tab.
2. Click the **Options** menu in the upper right corner of the course listing and choose **Unarchive Course**.
