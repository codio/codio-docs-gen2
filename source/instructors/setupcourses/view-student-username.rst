View Student Usernames
======================

Students can log in with their username if they can't remember their email address. If they have forgotten their username, organization owners can find their username on the Members tab on the Organization dashboard.

1. Click the gravatar to open the **Settings** page.
2. Under **My Organizations**, click the link for the organization you want to view.
3. On the **Members** tab, click **Students** and find the student's name in the list.
4. Provide the student with their username. 

If you are not an organization owner, you can obtain the student's username from the browser when you access student code.
