Force Language Highlighting
===========================
Codio automatically selects the syntax highlighting rules based on the file extension. If you open a file with an unknown file extension, the code is not highlighted.
To choose the language to use for syntax highlighting, click the language in the status bar of the code window.

ECMAScript 6 support
--------------------

ECMAScript 6 is enabled by default in javascript files.

If you wish additional configurations to apply, you can add a `.jshintrc` file to the root of your project/assignment. See https://github.com/jshint/jshint/blob/master/examples/.jshintrc for more information
