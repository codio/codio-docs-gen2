Share Project
=============

.. Warning:: Please note that Project Sharing via Project > Permissions feature will be disabled on or after July 8th 2024. Any existing projects shared via permission will also be removed.

You can share a project if it is public (**Project > Settings > General Settings > Public**). To share a project or link to a project from a web page, follow these steps.

1. Click the **Project** tab on the menu bar and choose **Share**.

2. Click one of the options at the top of the dialog (Twitter, Facebook, Email, or Link) to share the project.

3. On the **Share Your Project** dialog, select the option for how you want to embed or link to your project for the IDE to render it:

   - **Project URL** - Use this URL to display the project with the active panel or opened file configuration. The URL can change depending on what the user has active.

   - **Guide URL** - Use this URL to display your project with your :ref:`Guide <guides-intro>` automatically starting.

   - **With Layout** - Use this URL if you want to always use the exact panel and file configuration is currently opened. You should use this option if you want to embed it in a log post or page where the exact configuration needs to be retained.

  If you prefer to paste the URL for the **Project URL** and **With Layout** options, click the link to generate it in **Markdown** or **HTML** format and then paste the code.
