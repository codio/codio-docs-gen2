IDE Workspace
=============

The Codio IDE is a web-based, easy to use workspace when you are
learning to code.

Review the following common tasks to get you started using the
workspace:

-  :ref:`Add and Delete Folders <add-delete-folders`
-  :ref:`Add and Delete Files <add-delete-files>`
-  :ref:`Upload and Download Files <upload-download-files>`
-  :ref:`Open a File <open-file>`
-  :ref:`Export Project <export-project>`

When you open up a project in the IDE, the readme.md file in the root of
the project is displayed in a tab in markdown.

   :alt: Readme.md File

You can also select the README.md file in the Filetree. You can switch
between **Preview**, **Code**, or **Splitview** in the lower right
corner.

The **readme.md** file should be written in [markdown]
(http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics).

Exit the IDE
------------

You can exit the IDE and return to the Dashboard using one of the
following methods:

-  Click the **Project** tab on the menu bar and choose **Close**.
-  Click the Gravatar or your user name in the menu bar.
