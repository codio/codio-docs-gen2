Language server protocol
========================

The Language Server protocol is used to integrate features like auto complete, go to definition, find all references.

**Java, OCAML and Python** are currently available.

Python Example:

Implementing LSP support
------------------------

Enable LSP support in your [User](/docs/ide/customization/codio-prefs/) (or [Project](/docs/ide/customization/project-prefs/)) Preferences, entering

.. code:: ini

    [codio-lsp]
    enable_lsp_support = true

If you are [authoring](/docs/content/authoring/) content for use in a course/class, we recommend enabling as a [project preference](/docs/ide/customization/project-prefs/) as these will be applied over any preferences users may set

Installing language server protocols
------------------------------------

To install language server protocols, go to the menu **Tools->Install Software** and locate the relevant component.  Press the install button in the relevant row. The installation may take a few minutes and you should then :ref:`Restart <Restart and Reset>` your Box before proceeding.

Autocomplete
------------

Autocomplete is not automatically triggered as in HTML/CSS/JS files. To invoke autocomplete for language server protocol implemented files, use :

``Mac: Shift+Space``
    
``Others: Ctrl+Space``

If you wish to change the default preference to something else you can. See [User Preferences](/docs/ide/customization/codio-prefs/) for more on this
