IDE Access Permissions
======================

.. Warning:: Please note that Project Sharing via Project > Permissions feature will be disabled on or after July 8th 2024. Any existing projects shared via permission will also be removed.

By default, other users with read and write permissions cannot access your Codio box from the command line. However, you can grant access by assigning the Admin permission to the user. 

.. Note:: This feature requires an active payment plan.

For information about assigning permissions, see :ref:`Project Permissions <project-permissions>`.
