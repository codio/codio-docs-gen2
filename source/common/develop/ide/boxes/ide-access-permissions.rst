IDE Access Permissions
======================

By default, other users with read and write permissions cannot access your Codio box from the command line. However, you can grant access by assigning the Admin permission to the user. 

**Note:** This feature requires a paid subscription.

For information about assigning permissions, see :ref: Project Permissions <project-permissions>`.
