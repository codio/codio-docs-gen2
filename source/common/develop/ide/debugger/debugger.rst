Debugger
========

Codio offers an integrated, language specific debugger that supports the following languages.

-  Java
-  Python 2
-  Python 3
-  NodeJS
-  C and C++

**Note:** `Contact us </dashboard/support/>`__ if you would like support for other languages.

If you created a Codio Trial account, the **Demo Codio Debugger** project should be available in your **My Projects** list. Instructions for how to use the project are in the **README.md** file that opens when you open the project.

If the **Demo Codio Debugger** project is not in your list of projects, `go here <https://codio.com/home/starter-packs/b83690d5-6ff5-4f86-970a-768292c70aec/>`__ and then click **Use Pack** to install it.

If you are new to using a debugging tool, we suggest you view this useful `video tutorial <https://player.vimeo.com/video/165269077>`__.

Prerequisites
-------------

To use the Codio debugger, you must have the GDB component installed. If you installed Java, C, or NodeJS from a stack, the GBD components that support debugging are automatically installed.

However, if you manually installed these languages, you will be prompted to install the GDB component when you attempt to run the debugger. Simply click the link to install the component.
