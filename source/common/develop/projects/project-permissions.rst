Project Permissions
===================

When a project is created, you can choose to make it private or public. By default, the following rules apply to project permissions:

- Anyone can view and copy a public project but cannot edit it.
- No one but the project owner can view a private project.

To change the permissions on a project, follow these steps:

1. Click the **Permissions** tab and choose **Project**.

2. Select the permission level next to the user's name:

   - **Read** - User can only view the project.
   - **Write** - User can edit the project.
   - **Admin** - User can access the terminal and the deployment screens. Caution should be used when assigning a user Admin permission because they have full access to keys and any other private data that might be stored on the box.

Adding or Removing a User
-------------------------

To add a user to a box, follow these steps:

1. Enter the user name in the **Search** text box.
2. Select it and click **Add**.
3. Assign the permission level to the user.

To remove a user from a box, click the **X** button.
