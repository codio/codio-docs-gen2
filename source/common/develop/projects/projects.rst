Projects
========

A project is a Ubuntu server and is commonly referred to as a box. You can create as many projects (boxes) as needed, and with sudo privileges, you can install and configure them however you want. Each project box is fully isolated from your other project boxes.  

When opening a project, you are taken into the project server (box) and are presented with the Codio IDE. You can access the command line via a terminal window.

Project templates
-----------------

Codio works with a series of templates for software configurations, also commonly referred to as stacks. These templates deliver fully preconfigured servers in less than 5 seconds, no matter how complex the configuration. You can use our pre-configured templates or create your own. This template approach makes Codio easy to use, configure and adapt.

- You can take a snapshot of the software configuration on any box and add it to the **Stacks** template library.

- You can take a snapshot of the stack/project code workspace combination and add it to the **Starter Packs** template library.
