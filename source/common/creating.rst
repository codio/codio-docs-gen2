Creating Projects
=================

You can create your own projects using the web-based IDE in Codio. To access the project area, use the **BUILD** links in the left navigation pane.

To learn about how to create projects, jump to the main [Creating Project](/project/projects/#creating-and-importing-a-project) section.
