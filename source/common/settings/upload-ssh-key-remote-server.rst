Upload SSH Key to Remote Server

3. In the **Upload Key** section, enter the **Server** information and click **Upload**. Codio will upload your Codio SSH key to the server so you can make a secure connection.

You can then use the SSH key to connect to GitHub or BitBucket servers. See the :ref:`GitHub <github>` and :ref:`BitBucket <bitbucket>` topics for instructions on connecting to the servers.
