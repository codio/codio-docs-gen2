SSH Key
=======

An SSH public and private key pair is automatically generated for your account that can then be used when Codio attempts communication with an external server that requires authentication based on a public or private key, such as SSH terminal or SFTP. You access this key from the **SSH Keys** tab.

To connect to a remote server, you must :ref:`upload your SSH key to the remote server <upload-ssh-key-remote-server>`.
