Environment Variables
=====================
Environment Variables allow you to set your own variables in your projects. You access the **Environment Variables** from your project by going to **Codio > Preferences > Environment Variables** on the menu bar.

- These environment variables are defined on the user level and shared across all the users projects.
- When saved, the project needs to be restarted (**Project>Restart Box**) for the new variables to be available.
- **Environment Variables** are not supported for :ref:`Pair Programming <group-work>` assignments.
- **Environment Variables** are available to use within :ref:`Secure Scripts <auto-grade-scripts>`.


.. Important:: Be aware that if you change the `HOME` variable you are changing the entry point for profile and it could adversely affect the user variables. If you do change this variable, it is your responsibility how environment will behave after that.
