Resetting Your Password
=======================

You can request a password reset from your **Account** page.  <Ian, please verify this and also provide examples for when a student would reset password versus Change password.> <Diana This is correct. go to your ‘account’ area and you can see you can request reset password entering your email address
Why would students (or any users) want to reset instead of change… users could have logged in with ‘remember me’ so they don’t need to authenticate every time but then forgot what their password was and so can’t use the ‘change password’ as they can’t remember their current password>

1. Click your user name or gravatar in the lower portion of the navigation pane to open the **Settings** page.
