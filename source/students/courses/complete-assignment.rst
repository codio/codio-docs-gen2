Completing Assignments
======================

When you have completed an assignment you can mark it as completed (if the content author has not disabled this option) using one of the following methods:

- In the assignment, click the **Settings** icon and choose **Mark as Completed**.

- On the last page in the guide, mark it as completed.<Ian, where are guides and what do you click on the last page?> <Diana When students run guides (it starts automatically for them, on the last page is button ‘mark as completed’ … as above you won’t see it running as editor>

If there are any assessments in the assignment that have not been submitted, details are displayed so you can review before completing the assignment.

If you mistakenly mark an assignment as completed, contact your instructor. They can reset the status of the assignment so you can access it again.
