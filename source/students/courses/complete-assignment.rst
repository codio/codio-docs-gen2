- On the IDE menu bar, click **Education > Mark as Completed**. 

- On the last page in the guide, click the **Mark as Completed** button.

If there are any assessments in the assignment that have not been submitted, details are displayed so you can review before completing the assignment.

If you mistakenly mark an assignment as completed, contact your instructor. They can reset the status of the assignment so you can access it again.
