**Note**: If the assignment has been marked as completed, you can click the **Completed** button to access the grade feedback. If you want to view the assignment, click the assignment in the left panel. As the assignment is completed you will not be able to edit anything but can view the content. 

If your organization uses an LMS platform, a URL to the grade detail is also passed to your LMS so you can access it from the grading area in the LMS.
