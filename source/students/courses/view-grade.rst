Viewing Grades
==============
When your assignment has been graded and released by your instructor, you will see **Graded** showing in your dashboard:
<Ian, where do you see this and where is this image?>

   :alt: Graded

You can view the grade details from the **Feedback** page or the **Grade** field in the dashboard.

- Open the project and go to **Education > Feedback**:

     :alt: Feedback

- Click the **Grade** field in the dashboard:

     :alt: Access Grades

To view details about a grade, click the **Assessment** and view more information.

The **Partial Point** icon indicates assessments that support partial points and full points that were not awarded:

**Note**: If the assignment has been marked as completed, you can click the **Completed** button to access the grade feedback. If you want to view the assignment, click the project on the left hand side. As the assignment is completed you will not be able to edit anything but can view the content. <Ian, this is very confusing; are assignments and projects the same?>

If your organization uses an LMS platform, a URL to the grade detail is also passed to your LMS so you can access it from the grading area in the LMS.
