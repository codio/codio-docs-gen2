Forgot Your Password
====================

If you have forgotten your password, you can reset it using the following procedure:

1. On the Codio log-in page, click the **Lost your password** link.
2. Enter your **Email** or **Username** and click **Reset Password**.
3. Check your email inbox for an email notification and follow the instructions for resetting your password. <Ian, please verify this step; I'm just assuming this the final step> <Diana First email they get has link for them to click that then sends 2nd email that contains the new password. Standard process so anyone canâ€™t enter someone elses email address and reset the users password>


**Note:** If you do not have access to the email address you used when creating your Codio account, contact your instructor and they can reset the password for you.
