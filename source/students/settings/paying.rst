Paying for Codio Subscription
=============================

A Codio subscription gives you access to your courses for the semester. You can pay for your subscription using the **Billing** tab on the **Settings** page. The procedure you follow depends on whether you are paying for the subscription yourself or redeeming a code for a subscription that was obtained from your campus bookstore.

**Note:** A single subscription can be used for multiple courses in Codio during the specified timeframe.

Redeeming code from campus bookstore
------------------------------------
Some institutions provide Codio licenses through their campus bookstore. Your course instructor or course syllabus will specify if this is available at your school.

A single license can be used for a specified timeframe: 1 semester (5 months), 2 semesters (10 months), or a year. Specific license options depend on your local bookstore.

To obtain and activate a license from your campus bookstore, follow these steps:

1. Request one of the following subscriptions from your campus bookstore:

   - 1 Semester  - Codio 1-Semester Subscription - ISBN: 978-1-7331872-5-1
   - 2 Semesters - Codio 2 Semester Subscription ISBN 978-1-73331872-8-2
   - Annual - Codio Annual Subscription ISBN # 978-1-7331872-1-3

   The bookstore will give you a code to redeem and activate your subscription for the specified timeframe.

2. Log in to Codio following the instructions provided by your instructor. This may be through your local LMS (Canvas, Blackboard, Desire2Learn, Moodle, etc.) or through Codio.com using a course token.

   The first time you log in, a small banner is displayed in the upper portion of the screen requesting that you go to **Billing**.
   
3. Click the link in the banner, or click your **User name > Settings > Billing**.

4. From the **Plan** drop-down, choose **Redeem Code** and click **Upgrade**.

5. Enter the code that was provided to you. Note that the code is case sensitive so enter it exactly as provided to you.
