Forgotten passwords
===================

If you have forgotten your password, you should use the **lost password** link on the log-in page or enter your email in the reset password area (see image below) to reset your password automatically via email. If you do not have access to the email address you used in creating your Codio account, contact your teachers who can reset the password for you.

If you wish to change your password (you should also do this if you forgot your password and/or it was reset by your teacher) follow these steps:

1. Click on your name and profile picture (bottom left of screen)
