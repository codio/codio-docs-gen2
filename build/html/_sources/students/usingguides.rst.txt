Restore Current Files
---------------------
Sometimes you might make changes to your work that you don’t like or that you don’t want to keep.

The easiest way to get rid of these is to restore the original files in a assignment.
To do this:

1. Open the assignment you are working on. In the top right, choose the settings icon, and then **Restore current files**

If this does not achieve what you need, you can contact your class instructor who can reset the assignment back to its default state and you can start again as new.
